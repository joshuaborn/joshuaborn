## Hello👋

I am software engineer in the United States with over 10 years' experience returning to the profession after trying other career paths from 2017 to 2024. I worked as a software engineer from 2006 to 2017, mostly doing web development.

- 👨‍💻 I am currently looking for work. I am available for a remote role  or for a role in the Northern Virginia area.
- 🔭 I am currently working on a web app for splitting expenses called [Bentley Needs Money](https://github.com/joshuaborn/bentley-needs-money) and built with Ruby on Rails.
- 👯 I would like to collaborate on open source projects.
- 🤔 I am curious about learning a new programming language, such as Golang.
- 📫 I am easiest to reach via email.
