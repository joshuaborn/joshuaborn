## Hello <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

I am a software engineer in the United States with over 10 years' experience returning to the profession. I tried other career paths from 2017 to 2024, but before this I worked as a software engineer from 2006 to 2017 mostly doing web development.

- 👨‍💻 **I am currently looking for work.** I am available for a remote role  or for a role in the Northern Virginia area.
- 🔭 I am currently working on a web app for splitting expenses called [Bentley Needs Money](https://github.com/joshuaborn/bentley-needs-money) and built with Ruby on Rails.
- 👯 I would like to collaborate on open source projects.
- 🤔 I am curious about learning a new programming language, such as Golang.
- 📫 I am easiest to reach via email.
